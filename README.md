# Configurable Lab Environment using Devops

This application can be used to configure and setup lab environments.  
<br />

## Local setup
As of now there is only one service/folder i.e., the client/frontend.  
To get started, enter the below commands and spin up a development server for the react app.
```zsh
$ cd client
$ npm install or yarn       #if you use yarn use the second command
$ npm start or yarn start   #This will start a dev server on localhost:3000
```
In your browser open https://localhost:3000
